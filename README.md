# Vaccine-Scheduler-System
This project is a vaccine scheduler built in Java that interacts with an online database to store and manage vaccine-related information. The main goal was to design a simple scheduling tool that could efficiently handle vaccine appointments and streamline the data flow between users and the database.

I focused on implementing key functionalities like appointment management, real-time updates to the database, and user-friendly features for scheduling. Working on this project allowed me to improve my Java programming skills and better understand database integration. While thereâ€™s more to polish, this was a great hands-on experience in building practical tools with backend logic.
